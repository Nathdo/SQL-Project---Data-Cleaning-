# SQL-Project-Data-Cleaning

I am finishing a very interesting project in SQL, where I apply my knowledge to clean data. I noticed that this is a way of doing things that is quite rare in SQL (cleaning up data), so I took on this challenge. The first step in the project is to carefully review the data and identify inconsistencies, duplicates, missing values and formatting errors.

Using SQL, I will create scripts that will allow me to clean data quickly and efficiently. I will also use built-in functions from SQL to transform the data and format it in a consistent way. The ultimate goal is to have a clean and consistent set of data that one can then use to perform further analysis.
